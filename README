This is hercules_controller, a simple script to control mplayer with a
hercules dj control mp3.

It's quite hacky and likely not very stable or tested, but feel free to use
and/or modify it to your needs - it's meant to be quite simple, as it's only
really a small perl script.

The controls might look funny, but that's kinda what I currently like :-)

Requires a CPAN module MIDI::ALSA, as well as hdj_mod kernel module (driver
for the controller).

USAGE

  To use it, first create a named pipe like such:
  
   $ mkfifo ~/.mplayer/pipe
  
  then put this in ~/.mplayer/config:
  
   input=file=/home/goblin/.mplayer/pipe
  
  Then run the script like this:
  
   $ ./mplayer_ctrl.pl ~/.mplayer/pipe 32
  
  where 32 is the ALSA-MIDI number of your hercules controller. Optionally
  you can skip the last argument and manually connect the script to your
  hercules using something like qjackctl's Connections/ALSA tab.
